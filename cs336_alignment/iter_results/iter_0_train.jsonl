What is the smallest abundant number?\nAssistant: <think>", "response": "10 is an abundant number because its proper divisors are 1, 2, and 5, and 1 + 2 + 5 = 8, which is greater than 10. However, 9 is not an abundant number because its proper divisors are 1 and 3, and 1 + 3 = 4, which is less than 9.

A customer can choose one, two, or three meat patties, and any collection of condiments. How many different kinds of hamburgers can be ordered?\nAssistant: <think>", "response": " Since a customer can choose one, two, or three meat patties, and any collection of condiments, the number of different kinds of hamburgers can be calculated by multiplying the number of choices for meat patties by the number of subsets of condiments. There are 8 condiments, so there are 2^8 subsets of condiments. Therefore, the total number of different kinds of hamburgers is 3 * 2^8 = 768.</think> <answer> 768</answer>", "ground_truth": "768"}

The highest power is $x^4$, so the degree of $f(x)$ is 4. Since the degree of $f(x) + g(x)$ is 1, and the highest degree term in $f(x)$ is $x^4$, the two polynomials must have exactly one term in common with the same degree for cancellation.
