Since these three triangles together make a large equilateral triangle, we can relate the area of the large triangle to that of the small ones by recognizing that the area scales with the square of the side length. This means if the side length of the small triangle is $s$, then the area of one small triangle is $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2$. Therefore, the total area for four small triangles is $4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}s^2 = \\sqrt{3}s^2$.\n\nNow, let's find the side length of the large triangle. Since the total fencing also directly corresponds to the total side lengths of all triangles when removed, the large triangle has a side length of $4s$.
