What is their product?\nAssistant: <think>", "response": " Set up the equations: $x + y = 19$ and $x - y = 5$. Adding these equations, $2x = 24$, so $x = 12$. Substituting $x$ into one of the original equations, we find $y = 7$. </think> <answer> The product is $12 \\times 7 = 84$. Therefore, the answer is $\\boxed{84}$ </answer>", "ground_truth": "84"}

Express your answer as a common fraction.\nAssistant: <think>", "response": " To find the probability that a positive integer less than or equal to 24 is a factor of 24, we need to determine the total number of factors of 24 and divide it by the total number of integers less than or equal to 24. \n\nFirst, let's find the factors of 24. The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. There are a total of 8 factors. \nThe total number of integers less than or equal to 24 is 24. \nSo, the probability that a positive integer less than or equal to 24 is a factor of 24 is \n8/24, which simplifies to 1/3\n\nThe answer is 1/3\n</think> <answer> 1/3 </answer>", "ground_truth": "\\frac{1}{3}"}
