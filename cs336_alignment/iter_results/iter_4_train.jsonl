How many integer values of $x$ satisfy this condition?\nAssistant: <think>", "response": "Since the square root of $x$ is between 3 and 4, we can write $3 < \\sqrt{x} < 4$. Squaring each part of the inequality gives us $3^2 < x < 4^2$, or $9 < x < 16$. The integer values of $x$ that satisfy this inequality are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15.

For example, $P(23) = 6$ and $S(23) = 5$. Suppose $N$ is a two-digit number such that $N = P(N) +\nS(N)$. What is the units digit of $N$?\nAssistant: <think>", "response": "let $N = 10s + t$. Then we have $10s + t = st + s + t$. Simplifying this equation, we get $9s = st$. Since $s$ is a non-zero digit, we have $t = 9$.
